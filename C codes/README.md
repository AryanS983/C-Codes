# C Codes Collection

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C programming codes, projects, and resources, organized for academic and practical reference. The folder is structured to support learning, practicing, and implementing various algorithms and programming concepts in C.

## Folder Structure

- **DAA/**  
  Contains source codes and executables for Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) topics, including sorting, graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Floyd-Warshall, etc.), dynamic programming, and classic algorithmic problems.

- **Programming for Problem Solving/**  
  Organized by units, this section includes C programs and resources for foundational programming concepts, binary search, and a variety of problem-solving exercises.  
  - `questions.md`: Contains theory or coding questions for practice.
  - `Unit 1/` to `Unit 10/`: Unit-wise code and notes.

- **files/**  
  A diverse set of C programs and their compiled executables, covering basic to intermediate topics such as arrays, functions, sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, merge, quicksort), recursion, patterns, pointers, and more.


- **DAA.zip / Programming for Problem Solving.zip**  
  Compressed archives of the respective folders for easy sharing or backup.

## Usage

- Source files (`.c`) can be compiled using any standard C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Executables (`.exe`) are pre-compiled for Windows systems.
- Explore each folder for topic-specific codes and examples.

## Contribution

Feel free to use, modify, or extend these codes for your learning or projects. For any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
